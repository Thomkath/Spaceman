###### Spaceman Game
Welcome to Spaceman, a fun and interactive word guessing game inspired by Hangman but with a space twist. Your objective is to guess the word correctly by guessing individual letters or the entire word, all while avoiding the wrong guesses that add to the "spaceman's" demise. The game is designed for two players and includes a hint feature to help you if you're stuck.

**How to Play**
Start the Game:

- When you open the game, you'll see a series of buttons representing the alphabet (A-Z).
You'll also see an input field for entering your word guess and a "Guess" button to submit it.
The game alternates between two players (Player 1 and Player 2). The first player to make a correct guess wins the round.
Guessing Letters:

- Click on any letter button to guess if that letter is part of the hidden word.
If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the word display. If it’s not, it will be added to the incorrect guesses list.
If you guess the same letter again, a message will inform you that it has already been guessed.
Guessing the Word:

- If you're confident, you can type your guess for the entire word in the input field and hit the "Guess" button.
If the word is correct, you win the round. If it’s incorrect, a message will inform you of the mistake.
Hints:

- You can click on the "Get Hint" button to reveal a brief description of the word to help you guess it.
You can only use the hint once per round.
End of Game:

- The game will end when one player guesses the word correctly, or if the maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached.
After the game ends, you can press "Reset game" to start a new round.
